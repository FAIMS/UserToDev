If at some point you encounter a problem with your virtual FAIMS installation that you can't fix, you can request assistance from FAIMS directly. Send an e-mail to {\tt support.fedarch.org} and, given time and patience, you'll receive some resolution. If it's a pressing issue that requires immediate assistance, you can inquire about purchasing a support package which will provide more hands-on assistance.
