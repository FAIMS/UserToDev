This document will teach individuals familiar with the FAIMS system of efficient, comprehensive data collection how to create their own modules. No programming experience is required; all you need is a computer, some idea how to use it, and patience.

Because this guide starts from simple explanations and builds up to more complex applications, it's important to understand a section completely before you move on. Keep an eye out for our Test Your Knowledge questions. If at any point you can't confidently answer one, it might be a good idea to back up and re-read.
